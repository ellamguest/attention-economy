# Research plan

I'm still dealing with a lot of conceptual confusion so I'm reticent to make an overly prescriptive research plan at this point. However I need to make myself do one for two reasons:

1. I agree with the saying that 'plans are useless but planning is indispensable'. My natural fixed mindset chafes against the idea of spending time on a plan I don't think will actually happen. But the growth mindset I'm constantly working on building knows that the point of the exercise isn't the plan itself but the process of planning, which will help me develop conceptual clarity.
2. If I don't force some form on accountability by setting goalposts for myself then I will procrastinate and time will slip away from me (as it already has done so far). As an independent researcher I struggle with the lack of external motivation that comes with the structures of a normal job. So where possible I need to force myself to create structure. And structure starts with a plan.
