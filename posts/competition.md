'Attentional Brokerage—the business model that consists of converting attention into cash.' (page 784)

Tim Wu's 2019 paper '[Blind Spot: The Attention Economy and the Law](https://scholarship.law.columbia.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3030&context=faculty_scholarship)' sets out difficulties competition agencies have faced in addressing antitrust and consumer welfare concerns in these new digital markets.

This quote sums up the problem pretty well:

> Antitrust agencies, tasked with assessing the effects of mergers and controlling anticompetitive behavior, seem to lack a way to understand the market dynamics when the firms offer "free products" that are actually competing for attention. (page 771)

He defines the term *Attention Brokerage* as

> the resale of human attention. It is to attract attention by offering something to the public (entertainment, news, free services, and so on), and then reselling that attention to advertisers for cash. Examples of pure Attention Brokers include social media companies like Instagram and Facebook, search engines like Google or Bing, ad-supported publishers like Buzzfeed or AM News, and some television channels like CBS or NBC. (page 772)

[N.B. This includes pre-digital ad supported media. If I move on to examining content-based impacts at a later point this might tie back in re sensationalism.]

And goes on to outline how enforcers could better understand these markets

> Here’s how a better approach to [attention market mergers] would work. It would center on the recognition that these entities have consumer-facing products that are competing for attention, which is then resold to advertisers on the other side of the market. The trick, as with many antitrust matters, is market definition. (page 777)

Wu sets out the two issues that make this market difficult to define:

1) The product is "free" to users
2) The market is two-sided

## "Free" products

Users (aka consumers) do not pay money to use these services. According to modern competition frameworks this means the products are free to users. However Wu suggests that users pay with their "time spent" on these services.

> Contemporary antitrust doctrine **assumes cash markets** where customers spend fiat currency to buy goods or services. Consumer harm, under this approach, is primarily measured in terms of higher prices, reduced output, or other money-related harms. (page 773)

N.B. He doesn't explicitly reference the consumer welfare doctrine but my understanding is that is the modern doctrine that prioritizes prices.

The creates what Wu calls a 'blind spot' to markets where companies give away their product for 'free'.


*Add background on the SSNIPS test*

Wu offers the "*Attentional* Small but Significant and Non-Transitory Increase in Price" or A-SSNIPS test.

### Substitution

Wu then suggests that that concept of substitution can then be used to define the relevant market. His example here is Google Maps, Waze, and Apple Maps which are pretty clear cut substitutes for each other. Various national competition regulators considered the legality of Google's acquisition of Waze in 2013, but none blocked it. In February 2020 the FTC announced it would re-examine the acquisition but nothing seems to have come of that [cite, update?].

Here I am more skeptical than Wu - though still hopeful. If enforcers have difficulties considering cases of clear substitution, how can they be expected to define even murkier markets like social media? It is not so clear that Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, or Snapchat are substitutes for each other. So what are enforcers to do then.

I believe it is the responsibility on domain experts with deep knowledge of these markets to create more useful definitions for enforcers to apply. And I suspect that delving deeper in to attention and time spent will be the way to do this.

## Two-sided markets

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-sided_market)"

> A two-sided network typically has two distinct user groups. Members of at least one group exhibit a preference regarding the number of users in the other group; these are called cross-side network effects. Each group's members may also have preferences regarding the number of users in their own group; these are called same-side network effects.

> Like a typical platform, the Attention Broker brings together two groups: the public, and attention seekers (like commercial advertisers, but also others, like politicians). It also, as is typical for platform intermediaries, lowers its price to one side of the market (the public) by making its content appear free, and makes its profit on the other side (advertisers).

N.B. 'Attention seekers' captures not just commercial advertisers but also political advertising.

Attention brokers are distinct for intermediating between two different markets - one of attention and one of cash

> The Broker is bartering something desirable (the “honey”) for attention, and then reselling the attention for cash.

Wu also touches on targeted advertising:

> As suggested before, in a more advanced model, the Attention Broker re-sells not just attention in bulk, but specific, tailored tranches of attention de- signed to meet the needs of the buyer.

This will tie in to to later discussion of the specific technical affordances of online platforms

The attention broker sets a price on either side of the market (often free to the user, and the advertising rates in the cash market). But Wu defines a third pricing decision,

> "attentional price" ... which "usually involves deciding how much advertising to combine with desirable content.' (page 789)

I find this to be a really useful framing as it can tie in to the non-competition related themes. It is also known as the "advertising load"

## Enforcement actions

### Antitrust

### Mergers & acquisitions

In the US already consummated acquisitions can be challenged under either Section 7 of the Clayton Act, or Section 2 of the Sherman Act.

Suggested measures of inefficiencies:

- higher advertising prices
- increased ad-load experienced by consumers
- **diminished privacy protections** (e.g. by WhatsApps after acquisition by Facebook)

Wu notes that under US and UK law the merger review should

> prevent a firm from eliminating “maverick” competitors—those that introduce new technologies or business models—that might threaten the incumbent, either as a current matter, or as a potential competitor. (page 774)

The UK's Office of Fair Trading approved Facebook's acquisition of Instagram in part because at the time Facebook not have 'an important photo app' [*Wu's words, get the OFT's*]. Wu suggests that under the 'maverick' concept Instagram should have been considered a potential social networking rival.

I intuitively agree with Wu here, but I don't actually find his stated reasoning robust. He says that Facebook and Instagram 'were [already] competing for the time people might spend sharing photos and comments online'. This definition fits with the time spent model. But it obfuscates the tricky question of what attention is being spent on. It overstates the equivalence between sharing photos and sharing comments. One of the very reasons defining the market for social networks is difficult is because it isn't clear that those things compete.

So that leads us back to the question of how to define boundaries in the attention economy. Because, as I said I intuitively agree with his conclusion, but am not sure how I would improve on his reasoning to get there (i.e. how to define social network markets better).

His second argument re Facebook and Instagram is that Instagram should have been considered a potential rival to Facebook in advertising markets. That seems a strong argument to me. 

### Consumer harm

Wu has some stuff about 'attentional intrusions' as consumer harms which I'm not really interested in from this angle. It might tie in to content-based harms if I work on that later. I.e. whether a piece of content is considered 'intrusive' depends on how we value it. What we advertising in a form of content, though we usually use 'content' as shorthand for organic content. (Though moderating advertising should be considered a distinct type of content moderation.) So the idea of intrusion suggests there is an acceptable kind and scale of advertising, after which things become a consumer harm.

He does also say that attentional intrusions have be 'from other people' so that might be interesting to think on later.

Makes a really weird parallel to the difficultly in defining the kind of injury inflicted by people making phone calls on planes. It was actually an interesting problem to read and think about, but very out of left field.

> This essay provides a more concrete framework for considering the harm in attentional terms—as the non-consensual seizure of the scarce resource of attention, yielding cognitive impairment. (page 780)

'consequential cognitive impairments'? *such as addiction? opportunity costs? distraction? anger*

'Attentional decisions' involve both voluntary and involuntary mechanisms.

## Caveats, complexities, and open questions

Are attention markets exactly equal to ad-based markets? I haven't parsed this out yet. To do so I'd need to identify example products that fit one but not the other. I may understand this better when I get properly in to the two-sided markets aspect.

Time spent is not directly equal to attention given. Look at the process of dual-screening, such as checking social media on your phone while watching television on another device. Practically speaking this could lead to double counting of actual hours lived.

Additionally we spent time on some things that aren't part of the attention markets (e.g. school, work, traveling). Those things clearly aren't competitors to attention brokers. To add clarity I think the definition of 'time spent' needs to be flesh out more. 

To what extent, if any, does it matter that attention brokers are not intentionally charging users in time spent? This is often the way that they measure success [cite], but is it fundamentally the goal. A cases of Goodhart's law (probably not)? This is more a philosophical question I'm not particularly interested in but it is an argument I expect attention brokers to use against competition enforcers. But seems worthwhile to note that the intention of these companies wasn't to become attention brokers. They wanted consumers to view their goods without having to pay for them. The asset they then had to monetize was a portion of that viewing (to advertisers). Thus attention brokerage. It seems somewhat quibbly but I think it is an important distinction that attention brokers did not set out to be brokers, but that they are giving advertisers access to part of the value they were trying ot generate for themselves. E.g. they didn't set out to intermediate a two-sided market (as a health management work does) but chose that business model so as not to charge end-users for their service. Wu also notes that attention brokers sit between two separate markets, an attention market on one side and a cash market on the other. (page 788)

> The Broker is bartering something desirable (the “honey”) for attention, and then reselling the attention for cash.

American antitrust agencies don't publish their analysis so we don't actually understanding their reasoning when they don't bring a case forward. (page 774). Does this mean we only have evidence on reasoning in those cases they bring forward? (E.g. the suits filed in court). By comparison, how much analysis does the CMA publish? Does it have to do it preemptively because of the greater investigatory powers (e.g. things only go before a judge if the company challenges a decision)

Carving out social networking markets. (Originally) peer to peer networks (e.g. Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat). Broadcast networks (e.g. Twitter). Though difficult to determine based on form of ties because Facebook ties (friends) are undirected but Instagram and Twitter are both directed. Messaging (WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Signal). Community boards (Reddit).

How should we think about online display advertising? Here Google or whoever is serving a more explicit brokerage role, but from the perspective markets there actually three stakeholder groups being brokered between. In the attention market their are the users. Then in the cash market there are the buyers (advertisers) and the sellers (the websites, who are themselves also brokering user attention). How to we balance the brokering done by the advertising intermediary vs the website? That then ties in to content moderation issues when a website is unhappy with the content of advertising being displayed.
