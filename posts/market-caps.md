# Market Capitalizations

The goal of these page is to give concrete numbers to the size of the big tech firms.

Data taken from the [List of public corporations by market capitalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_public_corporations_by_market_capitalization#2022) wiki page.

N.B. This is based on market capitalization so only covers publicly traded companies. Will need to look at other measures to capture private companies such as TikTok.
