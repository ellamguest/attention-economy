Why do I think the approach is useful?

What outcomes do I expect from this work?

What is the outcomes pathway?

## Goal

To improve future regulation of online platforms to ensure that their actual and potential socio-economic benefits are supported while their risk are mitigated to an reasonably degree.

### Motivation

## Approach

### Non-domain specialization

#### Thematic

By not prioritizing any one form of regulation, I can better assess the relationships between the different approaches, to determine what trade-offs appear necessary, and to weigh up how those trade-offs should could be balanced. Though the actual weighing up with depend on the specific value of the relevant jurisdictions, communities, and individuals.

#### Execution

I'm currently very open to how I go about enact my ideas once I've clarified them. There are some paths I think I'm less likely to follow (e.g. academia), some I will be somewhat restricted in following (e.g. US policymaking as a non-American), and some in which there may be the potential for a large negative impact (e.g. working at a platform). 

All of these paths have some benefits and some limitations. I'm genuinely pretty agnostic right as to which approach I take, if any of them. Maybe I decide that being freelance and moving in to consulting is the way to go. I really don't have enough information to weigh up the options until I have a better understanding of where I think it's most important for me to focus my efforts.

So once I have more clarity on my positions I'll come back to this step to run a cost-benefit analysis of different career paths over the short to medium term.

### Clarifying my own thinking

Taking foot of the gas, not being reactionary but building a cohesive mental model for the whole regulatory landscape

### Identifying the key places for me to focus

This will depend on:

1. Impact - which regulatory approaches to I think are the most important
2. Timeliness - where legislation is already underway, how can I input to better decision-making. Or where I think legislation in needed sooner how can I advocate for more momentum.
3. Tractability - I am a pragmatist, not an idealist. If there is a policy I think would be preferable but highly unlikely to be implemented I would de-prioritize until the political landscape changes (if ever).

Because I'm concerned with clarifying tensions in existing approaches, I expect little of that I'd be working on to be neglected.

### Potential stumbling blocks

#### No clarity

I spend some time trying to build out my mental model and don't develop any clarity on what issues would be most effective. I would then consider working in to a more impactful field (e.g. AI policy) or focusing on a related line of work that I would find the most rewarding for other reasons (e.g. working at a platform to improve impacts).

#### Freezing or commitment phobia

I get comfortable working alone building my model and put of making any decisions that step towards actual real world impact. Or I feel incapable of committing to a specific career trajectory. If I can make freelance have real world effects (i.e. publishing and 'influencing') I can try that.
