Summary of GDPR

How do the new EU bills update?

What other countries have consumer privacy legislation?

## US Federal

It doesn't look like US federal regulation is coming to states are writing their own laws. The California law takes after an EU one. Whereas Utah and other states have introduced much more business-friendly laws.

Are consumer advocacy groups not doing enough advocacy? (https://www.protocol.com/policy/virginia-maryland-washington-big-tech). 'Ed Mierzwinski, a senior director at the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, said he and other national consumer and privacy groups didn't find out about this bill until a few weeks ago.' Feels like a cop-out. I appreciate that these groups have limited resources, but they need to be preemptive in learning what laws are on the horizon rather than waiting to be informed about them.

What is the FTC's privacy remit? New Commissioner Bedoya has a privacy background. He Founded the Center on Privacy and Technology at Georgetown.

The May 2022 FTC complaint against Twitter cites privacy concerns. It states that between 2014 and 2019 Twitter requested users provided their phone numbers and email addresses, stating they would be used for security purposes, but Twitter then also used that contact information to target advertising. The claim states that this was deceptive as Twitter 'buried' such notice in its privacy policy.
[On FTC’s Twitter Case: Enhancing Security Without Compromising Privacy](https://www.ftc.gov/policy/advocacy-research/tech-at-ftc/2022/05/ftcs-twitter-case-enhancing-security-without-compromising-privacy)

> Generic, broad claims buried in a lengthy document do not override more specific, just-in-time statements made to consumers specifically in the context of when they are providing their information – in this case, about the use of contact information for security purposes. If a company says at the point of collection that consumers’ information will be used for a particular purpose, consumers should be able to rely on that promise.

Having no experience with the FTC's approach to privacy concerns such a strong statement took my by surprise. It makes me feel quibbly by pointing out that Twitter didn't state at the point of collection that contact information would *only* be used for security purposes. From my 2022 vantage point it seems naive that a user wouldn't expect their contact information to be used for targeted advertising. But I am not the average user, and 2014 was a very different time.

They cite this as 'a basic tenet of consumer protection law' and reference the FTC’s “Dot.Com Disclosures” guidance':

> It is highly unlikely that consumers will read disclosures buried in ‘terms of use’ and similar lengthy agreements. Even if such agreements may be sufficient for contractual or other purposes, disclosures that are necessary to prevent deception or unfairness should not be relegated to them.  Similarly, simply because consumers click that they ‘agree’ to a term or condition, does not make the disclosure clear and conspicuous.

Also - again a positive surprise - it turns out the FTC has had guidelines on ['How to Make Effective Disclosures in Digital Advertising'](https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/attachments/press-releases/ftc-staff-revises-online-advertising-disclosure-guidelines/130312dotcomdisclosures.pdf) since at least 2013!

In the Twitter complaint they include a 'novel feature' by requiring Twitter to allow users to use multi-factor authentication that does not require giving Twitter a phone number (e.g. via security keys or an authentication app).

## Forecasting

What will be the implications on the bifuracted state-based framework? Will it be messy or allow a marketplace of options?

    "Now, when I talk to state lawmakers or state staff members and say, 'Hey, it's a really bad idea to have a state patchwork of laws,' I just hear silence from them because they're like, 'Well, Congress still hasn't done anything,'" said Billy Easley, a senior tech policy analyst with Koch-backed Americans for Prosperity, which advocates against state-level legislation on privacy and speech.

Privacy rights should be inelastic - e.g. if a user is based in CA it shouldn't matter where the company is based. How the company collects and processes the user's data should fall under CA law.

The difficulty here is  double edge privacy sword - the company must know that the user is in CA to apply the CA laws. Therefore it requires the company to capture and process at least that level of location data. Is that something that the companies will actually have difficultly complying with.

Are the laws based on residence or current location. E.g. If I live in the UK and go to California on vacation, does UK or CA law apply when I'm in CA?

Because it's inelastic there could be a Brussels Effect. A motivation for the level of tech lobbying is to make sure a plurality of states have friendly regulation. If only two states were friendly and the rest were burdensome, then the Brussels effect would lead the companies to just harmonize to the higher standards to avoid having to maintain a complex network of product versions.

I suspect that the lobbying really ramped up after tech 'lost' California is that sense.
