### Assorted questions & ideas

This is the beginning of a long list of questions I have related to my attention economy research. It's a place to dump ideas I have as they come up,
to possibly come back to at a later point. If I do end up writing something on a subject I link to that. Occasionally I try to apply some structure to help
structure my overall thoughts. For now I've created a few separate headings that I expect to get messy soon.


#### Empirical
- How do SMCs define themselves to stakeholders - esp advertisers and shareholders?
  - Sources: advertising portals, shareholder meeting notes



#### Competition
- How will the Brussls effect apply to SMCs? Online platforms?
  - What features are the least divisible? The most?
