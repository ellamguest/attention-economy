# Assorted questions & ideas

This is the beginning of a long list of questions I have related to my attention economy research. It's a place to dump ideas I have as they come up,
to possibly come back to at a later point. If I do end up writing something on a subject I link to that. Occasionally I try to apply some structure to help
structure my overall thoughts. For now I've created a few separate headings that I expect to get messy soon.

## Thematic

### Competition

- How will the Brussels effect apply to SMCs? Online platforms? (also #forecasting)
  - What features are the least divisible? The most?

### Content moderation & free speech

- To what extent can the issues be better addressed by focusing on algorithmic amplification?
  - Which issues, if any, will always be a problem of take down vs leave up rather than reach?
- Would transparency mandates violate the First Amendment? (See [Eric Goldman paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4005647)
- What issues are missed by focusing on amplification rather than content?

### User privacy & data

- Do user controls (e.g. opt outs vs opt ins) ever actually work?
  - Empirical updates on the impacts of ATT of 3Ps?
- Where do competition and privacy fixes clash? Which of this can be aligned? Are any fundamentally opposed?
- What do I think about tech lobbying? Especially the idea of lobbyist 'writing' state laws directly?
  - Do I expect lawmakers to do better themselves?
  - Are no law better than weak laws?
    - Are weak state laws sticky or likely to be improved over time? I would expect state laws to be less sticky than federal ones

### Content harms

- How to balance human rights with the jurisdiction-based approach?

## Overarching

### Empirical

- How do SMCs define themselves to stakeholders - esp advertisers and shareholders?
  - Sources: advertising portals, shareholder meeting notes
- What is the evidence on impact of mobile device screen time notifications? Do they lead users to reduce time on SM?
- What is the best evidence of trailing policy and governance changes? (E.g. along the lines of [Stanford's RegLab](https://reglab.stanford.edu/about/))
- What is the evidence on the actual effectiveness of targeted advertising? Cost benefit analyses on the privacy trade-offs? And would users pay them?

### Conceptual

- To what extent do these concepts overlap with web 2? Is that still a useful framework?
- How does the attention economy model diverge from other approaches?
- Is the nature of the content fundamental to whether one can be 'addicted' or 'wasting one's attention' on it? Or is it a matter of proportion? I could eat more apples than chocolate before being addicted? I could watch more news than TikToks before being considered addicted? I'm not familiar with literature on addiction, but am going off my expected societal norms/judgments.

### Forecasting

- How will things change with web 3?
- What will the platforms look like in 10 years?
- How will policy changes fail? (e.g. 1A block on transparency mandates)

### Regulatory

- How accurate are fears of regulatory ossification or unintended consequences? How often are decisions actually undone?
