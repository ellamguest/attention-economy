# Assorted questions & ideas

This is the beginning of a long list of questions I have related to my attention economy research. It's a place to dump ideas I have as they come up,
to possibly come back to at a later point. If I do end up writing something on a subject I link to that. Occasionally I try to apply some structure to help
structure my overall thoughts. For now I've created a few separate headings that I expect to get messy soon.

## Thematic

### Competition

- How will the Brussels effect apply to SMCs? Online platforms? (also #forecasting)
  - What features are the least divisible? The most?

### Content moderation & free speech

- To what extent can the issues be better addressed by focusing on algorithmic amplification?
  - Which issues, if any, will always be a problem of take down vs leave up rather than reach?

### User privacy & data

## Overarching

### Empirical

- How do SMCs define themselves to stakeholders - esp advertisers and shareholders?
  - Sources: advertising portals, shareholder meeting notes
- What is the evidence on impact of mobile device screen time notifications? Do they lead users to reduce time on SM?

### Conceptual

- To what extent do these concepts overlap with web 2? Is that still a useful framework?

### Forecasting

- How will things change with web 3?
