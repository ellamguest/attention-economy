# Optionality *(vs optimization)*

My thinking on this really started to solidify while reading the book *System Error* which I give my thoughts on [here](system-error.md). But it relates to some tensions I'd already started coming across in my own life.

My case of Soylent given in the book is a good place to start:

> In an introductory video posted on YouTube, Rhinehart explained, “What I really learned was how to break problems down. Everything is made of parts, everything can be broken down. Unlike most other foods which prioritize taste and texture, Soylent was engineered to maximize nutrition; to nourish the body in the most efficient way possible.”

This lays out pretty neatly the simplification process necessary to undertake optimization. You can break a problem (eating) down to component parts when you strip away the squishy subjective bits (pleasure, memory).

I don't take issue with the desire to create an efficient device for those who want to optimize nutrition by stripping out traditional meals and reducing consumption time. I'm genuinely happy for those people that they have that option. Emphasis on *option*. Baring some kind of dystopian disaster - whilst people have choice the masses will not choose Soylent and it's ilk to dominate over traditional food.

...creating *an* optimized solution (for some, by their own lights) rather than *the* best solution for all

## Some side notes

On dystopian aftertastes:

> Rhinehart called his invention Soylent, taking his inspiration from a 1966 novel depicting an overpopulated world with dwindling resources in which a new food, made from soy and lentils (soy + lent), is created in order to feed people. For most folks, however, the name evokes the 1973 film adaptation of the novel, Soylent Green starring Charlton Heston. In the movie, people live on a wafer they believe to be made from plankton. The wafer is revealed in the final scenes to be produced from human flesh, and the dystopia of overpopulation turns out to be an even greater horror in which cannibalism is the only way to survive. Rhinehart never claimed to be a branding genius.

So not only is it named after future gruel, it's also partially named after long pig. Yum.

I use the term 'traditional meals' a lot. I'm not really happy with that term - in general I'm very skeptical or valuing something because it's traditional. But my gut was to go with 'normal food' and I really didn't like the normative bias that that created.

I was going to refer to Soylent and co as 'meal replacement drinks' but I think the emphasis on 'drinks' it probably limiting, and shown by the current popularity of the [potato only diet](https://slimemoldtimemold.com/2022/04/29/potato-diet-community-trial-sign-up-now-lol/) on some parts of the internet I expect there to still be some scope for further optimizing nutrition delivery systems.
