# Content harms

I didn't originally set out to include content-based harms as a theme. I expect three thematic headliners: competition, content moderation, and privacy. I wanted to take a structural approach to the issues and avoid the messy subjectivities of content as much as possible. That's difficult enough to do when grappling with content moderation, it seemed futile to me to attempt to do that for content harms.

But they kept popping up. Obviously. As I continued to wrap my head around the concept of the attention economy is became clearer that I couldn't disambiguate attention from *what people are paying attention to*. So, rather begrudgingly, as I delved in to the three themes of my original focus, I started dumping any references to content harms in to this document. My plan is to figure out this section last, as I've developed have a better idea of the emerging narrative around the other themes.

It's not my intention to ever write an opus on content harms. But it will be necessary to have a clear understanding of how the relate to the other themes, to be able to fully flesh out the model of the attention economy.

## Addiction

Addiction as a harm isn't directly related to content. It can be somewhat content agnostic. However a valuation of the object of addiction is implicit to the concept, and certainly to our level of concern. Being addicted to exercise is perceived as less bad then being addicted to cigarettes, though over-exercising can certainly have negative outcomes.

I'm already struggling to keep my writing on these issues descriptive rather than normative. To try to make clear, unambiguous statements than aren't laden with buried value judgments. This is why I didn't want to write about content harms!!!

I guess that I'm trying to say is that, when it comes to people talking about social media addiction, the issue isn't just that addictions. But that by acting on our addiction and consuming excess social media content we are often giving our precious attention to content that at best lacks long-term value, or at worst actively harms us or others. Even when the content itself has value, excess consumption means we lack attention to give to other things that might be of higher value. There is an opportunity cost when we spend time on social media and not other things.
