# Thoughts on *System Error*

The 2021 book *System Error: Where Big Tech Went Wrong and How We Can Reboot* by Stanford professors Rob Reich, Mehran Sahami, and Jeremy M. Weinstein - a philosopher, engineer, and political scientist.

The book sets out the 'optimization mindset' that leads the technologists and venture capitalists that dominate Silicon Valley. It focuses on how to drive to define quantitative metrics leads those innovators to ignore complicated issues that are difficult to operationalize and the resulting externalities that have growing social and economic impacts.

It's about figuring out how to balance unfettered technological innovation with the need for democratic leaders and institutions to minimize harms to citizens. I'm really enjoying the book's take, but I'm still working throught it so my thoughts are very messy. Here I'll compile the quotes I find most catchings and the thoughts and questions I have in response to them. I think this will really help inform how I think about my theory of change.

> In revealing that mindset, we confront the core issue: that well-intentioned optimizers fail to measure all that is meaningful, and when their creative disruptions achieve great scale, they impose their values and decisions upon the rest of us. A better strategy would replace the blinkered technocratic governance by coders and powerful tech companies with the messy, inefficient, yet empowering process of deciding what values to promote through what we call democracy.

E: But some jurisdictions *aren't* democratic. How should the dominance of the optimizer mindset be balanced there?


> The third camp of ethical concern is social and political ethics. This involves questions about public policy, regulation, and governance. The most interesting—and the most difficult—ethical challenges fall into this third category, and these are the challenges that will occupy us most frequently in this book. **Social and political ethics involve confronting and resolving trade-offs between rival values that we all acknowledge we care about. The issue here is not about discerning the difference between right and wrong and learning how to do the right thing; it is about identifying the multiple good things we care about and deciding what to do when they cannot be simultaneously realized in full.** (emphasis added)
