# Content moderation

## Taking down vs leaving up

## Amplification

Specifically algorithmic amplification that leads the content to reach a larger audience than it would have 'naturally'.

Clarify definitional distinction with virality.

Different from - but related to - content that is designed to be viral (often by being incendiary). Those processes obviously feed in to each other, but it's important to distinguish between technical mechanisms and content-based mechanisms.

Bots can be a form of amplification by users, rather than by the company

Algorithmic curation + catchy content (need a better term for this) ---> amplification/virality

## A free market of content moderation

Jurisdictions will set some hard limits. We already have some legal hard lines (CASM, copyright) and some semi legal semi social hard lines (adult materials, sexual solicitation).

New limits are developing and will continue to develop. Some will be progressive, so will be regressive.

But some subjects will never have bright lines of acceptability. For these I advocate a free market approach whereby users can 'vote with their feet'.

And that brings us back to competition and a more balanced product offering. I wees two approaches

1. a more diversified marketplace. Facebook, plus a more liberal minded version, plus a more right wing minded version. However I don't think this structure will work if their fully siloed, they'll be a need for some level of interoperability.

I think the dominant firms will fight that tooth and nails and it will even structural and technical changes that will be difficult to get right. Therefore I think the second option, at least in the shirt to medium term, is more practical. Perhaps it can be a gateway to the second?

2. Middleware layered on top.

Personalized algorithms based on user feedback. Already have 'i don't like this' but they're pretty weak mechanisms.
