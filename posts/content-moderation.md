# Content moderation

## Taking down vs leaving up

## Amplification

Specifically algorithmic amplification that leads the content to reach a larger audience than it would have 'naturally'.

Clarify definitional distinction with virality.

Different from - but related to - content that is designed to be viral (often by being incendiary). Those processes obviously feed in to each other, but it's important to distinguish between technical mechanisms and content-based mechanisms.

Bots can be a form of amplification by users, rather than by the company

Algorithmic curation + catchy content (need a better term for this) ---> amplification/virality
