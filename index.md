## The Attention Economy

I've been working on subjects related to social media, online platforms, and big tech for years. I've worked on issues around market competition, content moderation, algorithmic curation. I think these issues are important, and something I want to continue working on. But given the piecemeal nature of my experience so far I don't have a consistent narrative that encompasses all of these issue in one. The more I've thought about it the more I think that the concept of the 'attention economy' might be the central metaphor I've been looking for.

So this is where I'll be working through my thoughts on the attention economy, testing whether it is the correct model on which to build out my understanding of these interrelated issues.

My thoughts are currently messy, so my writing here will be messy for a while as well. My plan is to use this space to work out my ideas in a public(-ish) format with some form of accountability. Eventually, the backlog should serve as a kind of research diary showing the development of my thoughts over time. I expect to get things wrong, and I plan to do that publicly.

I'm keeping a [running list of questions and ideas](posts/questions.md).
